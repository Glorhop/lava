.. index:: deploy to avh

.. _deploy_to_avh:

to: avh
*******

This deployment method handles the following tasks in serial.

* Download the ``kernel``, ``dtb`` and ``rootfs`` images required by AVH custom firmware.
* Generate a ``Info.plist`` file for the meta information about firmware version, type, build, unique identifier, and device identifier.
* Create a zip package that contains the images and the ``Info.plist`` file.

Example definition:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - deploy:
      to: avh
      options:
        model: rpi4b
        api_endpoint: https://app.avh.corellium.com/api
        project_name: "Default Project"
      timeout:
        minutes: 30
      images:
        rootfs:
          url: https://example.com/rpi4b/nand
          format: ext4
          # root partition for LAVA test overlay
          root_partition: 1
          # partition for custom overlays
          partition: 1
          overlays:
            modules:
              compression: xz
              format: tar
              path: /
              url: https://example.com/rpi4b/modules.tar.xz
        kernel:
          url: https://example.com/rpi4b/kernel
        dtb:
          url: https://example.com/rpi4b/devicetree

options
=======

A dictionary of AVH configuration.

model
-----

This ``model`` key is crucial and mandatory. ``avh`` deploy action needs it to
generate ``Info.plist`` file. ``avh`` boot action needs it to create instance.

Here are the tested models in LAVA.

* rpi4b
* imx93

Other models that capable to run Linux should work too.

api_endpoint
------------

(optional): AVH API endpoint defaults to https://app.avh.corellium.com/api.

project_name
------------

(optional): AVH project name defaults to ``Default Project``.

images
======

A dictionary of images to provide the images needed for creating AVH Linux
firmware zip package.

rootfs
------

OS disk image file.

url
^^^

.. include:: actions-deploy-images-url.rsti

format
^^^^^^

Specify disk image format for LAVA to apply overlay. ``ext4`` is the only
supported format now.

root_partition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify disk image root partition index for LAVA to apply overlay. Disk image
partition index 0 usually is the boot partition, while index 1 usually is the
root partition.

overlays
^^^^^^^^

AVH doesn't support adding custom Kernel modules to custom Linux firmware
package yet. Fortunately, this is supported in LAVA by applying custom
``overlays.modules`` into the ``rootfs`` image.

kernel
------

The Linux kernel in the ``Image`` format.

dtb
---

The device tree for Linux in binary ``.dtb`` format.
