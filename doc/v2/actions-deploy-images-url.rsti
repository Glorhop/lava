Specifies the URL to download. All downloads are checksummed using ``md5sum``
and ``sha256sum``

URLs are checked during the test job validation to ensure that the file can be
downloaded. Missing files will cause the test job to end as Incomplete.

URLs **must** use one of the supported schemes, the first element of the URL.

.. topic:: Supported schema

 * ``http://``
 * ``https://``
 * ``file://``
 * ``lxc://``

URLs allow placeholder for `http`, `https` and `file` schema.

  - deploy:
      timeout:
        minutes: 120
      to: tftp
      kernel:
        url: http://{FILE_SERVER_IP}/linux/Image-imx8mmevk.bin
        type: image
      persistent_nfs:
        address: "{FILE_SERVER_IP}:/var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/linux/imx8mm_rootfs"
      dtb:
        url: http://{FILE_SERVER_IP}/linux/imx8mm-evk.dtb
      os: debian

.. note:: admin can define any placeholder and assign an address to it in device dictionary.
          LAVA then substitutes the placeholders in job with the `static_info` to generate a new `url`.

  .. code-block:: jinja

    {% set static_info = [{'FILE_SERVER_IP': "10.192.244.104"}] %}
