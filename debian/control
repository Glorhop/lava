Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture dispatcher
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides lava-dispatcher to dispatch
 LAVA jobs to configured devices, for Python3 only.
 .
 A range of devices are supported for ARM and
 x86 architectures.

Description: LAVA dispatcher host tools
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides tools needed on a host system to be used with
 container-related jobs. This package must be installed on a host
 system when lava-dispatcher runs inside a container on that host.

Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture server
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing. Extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides the Apache and WSGI configuration and LAVA
 support files to run the validation server on the local Apache
 instance as a lava-server virtual host as well as the scheduler
 and dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports configuration as a
 remote worker and needs to be removed from existing workers.
 Workers must only install lava-dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports Python2.

Package: lava-common
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python3:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture common
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package contains common Python code to support lava-server
 and lava-dispatcher.

Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture metapackage
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be

 .
 This metapackage brings in all LAVA components on a single
 machine. Some suggested packages may not be available for all
 architectures.

Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture LXC Mocker
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package contains set of mocker scripts that mocks each of
 the lxc commands that LAVA uses. It does not support all commands
 and options that lxc provides, but just the ones that LAVA uses.
 Test jobs using LXC can then be replicated in Docker.

Package: lava-coordinator
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, lava-common (= ${binary:Version}), python3
Description: LAVA coordinator daemon
 This package provides coordinator daemon to provide communication and
 synchronisation methods for test jobs running on multiple configured devices
 on instances of LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture).
 .
 One coordinator daemon can support more than one LAVA instance in a single
 lab.
