LAVA dispatcher - automated testing of Linaro images
====================================================

The LAVA dispatcher allows automated testing of Linaro images.

Documentation
=============

lava-dispatcher documentation is installed as part of the lava-server-doc
package and is available on each LAVA instance,
e.g. http://localhost/static/docs/v2/ or https://validation.linaro.org/static/docs/v2/

Reporting Bugs
==============

The LAVA software team use Jira [1] to track bugs. Bugs / issues, feature
requests, enhancements and problems can be either reported directly into JIRA
using a CTT [2] ticket or via the lava-users [3] mailing list. Updates to each
JIRA ticket will be sent to the lava-users [3] mailing list.

If you do not already have a Linaro account, you can choose to Register with
Linaro as a Community contributor [4] in order to file a new CTT ticket. It is
often useful to discuss the full details of the problem on the lava-users
mailing list before creating a ticket. One of the LAVA software team member
can then create a ticket on your behalf and keep the list updated as the work
progresses.
