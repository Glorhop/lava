# Configuration example
# Each dispatcher might have a configuration file like this one.
# Use the fully qualified hostname of the worker as the filename,
# as shown in the lava-master logs, and create the file in
# /etc/lava-server/dispatcher.d on the *master*.

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher has many IPs
#dispatcher_ip: <this-dispatcher-ip>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from slave httpd
# server or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_http_ip: <dispatcher-http-ip>:<port>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from nfs server
# or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_nfs_ip: <dispatcher-nfs-ip>:<port>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from tftpd server
# or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_tftp_ip: <dispatcher-tftp-ip>:<port>

# Set this key, if you want to change the default lxc creation path
# No trailing /
# The default path is /var/lib/lxc
#lxc_path: <custom-path>

# Prefix for all temporary directories
# If this variable is set, the temporary files will be created in
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<prefix><job_id> instead of
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<job_id>
#prefix: <prefix>

# Set this variable when using http caching service based on url substitution
# like KissCache
# When downloading resources, lava dispatcher will use this formatting string
# instead of the original url.
#http_url_format_string: "https://cache.lavasoftware.org/api/v1/fetch/?url=%s"
